<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better 
  organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions 
  of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen
   could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary 
   requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling,
    making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

    1. Accuracy
  Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure 
  accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide 
  accurate performance and payroll data.
  <br>
  2. Economics
  Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting,
   buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large 
   organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
  <br>
  3. Productivity / Efficiency
  Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets
   and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an 
   automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll 
   system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity 
   and improves profits. And many more like visibility/ Insights, Hassle Free Workflow Management, Flexibility, Integration/ Configuration,
